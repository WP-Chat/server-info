# Server Rules

We don't want to be too strict and don't have many rules, but have found through experience some rules (or guidelines if you will), are necessary for keeping the peace and creating a most welcoming and inclusive space.

Please follow these respectfully. If you don't, we maintain the right to kick you from our server.

## Rules

### 1. Choose the right channel

When you want to post something, consider all the channels we have, and choose the most appropriate one (hint: there's more than two). You are not allowed to post the same thing in multiple channels (or multiple servers) because this will waste peoples time.

### 2. No advertising/spam

Do not blatantly promote or advertise your services, your business, your websites, your Discord server, your YouTube channel or anything alike.

### 3. No NSFW content

This is clearly not the place for that.

### 4. Behave

Rude behavior or anything worse, will not be tolerated. Respect your fellow netizens.

Exceptions:
- You can "promote" it when someone asks about it.
- You can have 1 active project in #project-review.
- You can have 1 active "Looking for clients" thread in #jobs-and-collabs.

### 5. No illegal activity

No piracy of software or media. No GPL bullshit. No nulling. No hacking. No cracking. No doxxing. No (D)DoS'ing. No account/follower/email list trading. No black hat SEO.

Any meta discussion of illegal activity may not link to, promote or encourage the activity.

### 6. No unsolicited DMs

Do not message or friend request our users unless they explicitly give you permission.

To report unsolicited contact, make a screenshot and send it to *one* moderator (Administrator).

### 7. No politics/religion

No politics. No religion. No debates or discussions about anything that could start a fight at a birthday party.

## Related guidelines

Above are some of our hard rules that we will actively follow. This leaves some grey area for which we want to warn you. If you go in this direction, know you're on thin ice.

If you don't know how a person will take the joke, don't make the joke. We want this server to be as safe and welcoming as possible.

If you have an issue with something or someone on this server, please DM *one* moderator (administrator) with all relevant details. They will discuss internally, take action and get back to you.

## Summary

Look, basically, we like to help, but weâ€™ll hold you to a standard as well. 

Help us help you. And do it all with respect of the members here that are volunteering time to help.
