# WordPress Chat rules

Welcome to WordPress Chat! We're the largest WordPress community on Discord, and we're happy to have you with us.

Before you get started, we need you to be aware of the rules. They're pretty standard for Discord servers, but it's your responsibility to follow them.

Breaking the rules will generally get you a warning, and 3 warnings will get you banned. A warning expires after a month, so an honest mistake will not haunt you.

## Choose the right channel

When you want to post something, consider all the channels we have and choose the most appropriate one. You are not allowed to post the same thing in multiple channels or multiple servers, because this will waste people's time.

## No advertising/spam

Do not blatantly promote or advertise your services, business, websites, Discord server, YouTube channel, or anything else.

## No NSFW content

Obviously, this server is not the place for that.

## Behave

We will not tolerate rude behavior. Respect your fellow netizens.

Exceptions:
- You can mention your stuff when someone asks about it. No sockpuppets!
- You can have 1 active project in <#1072896563459919896>.
- You can have 1 active "Looking for clients" thread in <#1072695345995333653>.

## No illegal activity

No piracy of software or media. No GPL bullcrap. No nulling. No hacking. No cracking. No doxing. No (D)DoS'ing. No account sharing. No account/follower/email list trading. No black hat SEO.

You may discuss these activities (for example, when you fall victim to a scam), but links, promotion, and encouragement are prohibited.

## No unsolicited DMs

Do not message or send friend requests to our users unless they explicitly give you permission.

To report unsolicited contact, make a screenshot and share it in a thread in <#1152232675692777533>.

## No politics/religion

No politics. No religion. No debates or discussions about anything that could start a fight at a family reunion.

# Guidelines

If you have another minute, we highly recommend reading <#823609056714555472>, which contains our community guidelines. Not following the guidelines will not get you in trouble, but your time here will likely be less productive.
