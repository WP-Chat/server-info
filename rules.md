# Server Rules

We want to be relaxed and have few rules, but through experience, we found that some rules (or guidelines) are necessary for keeping peace and creating a most welcoming and inclusive space.

Please follow these respectfully. We maintain the right to kick you from our server if you don't.

## Rules

### Behave

We will not tolerate rude behavior. Respect your fellow netizens.

### No NSFW content

Obviously, this server is not the place for that.

### No advertising/spam

Do not blatantly promote or advertise your services, business, websites, Discord server, YouTube channel, or anything else.

Exceptions:
- You can "mention" your stuff when someone asks about it. No sockpuppets!
- You can have **_one_** active project in #project-review.
- You can have **_one_** active "Looking for clients" thread in #jobs-and-collabs.

### No illegal activity

No piracy of software or media. No GPL bullcrap. No nulling. No hacking. No cracking. No doxing. No (D)DoS'ing. No account/follower/email list trading. No black hat SEO.

You may discuss these activities (for example, when you fall victim to a scam). But links, promotion, and encouragement are prohibited.

### No unsolicited DMs

Do not message or send friend requests to our users unless they explicitly give you permission.

To report unsolicited contact, make a screenshot and send it to **_one_** moderator (aka Administrator).

### No politics/religion

No politics. No religion. No debates or discussions about anything that could start a fight at a birthday party.

## Related guidelines

Above are some of the rules we will actively follow. They leave some grey area for which we want to warn you: if you go in the wrong direction, know you're on thin ice.

If you don't know how a person will take the joke, don't make the joke. We want this server to be as safe and welcoming as possible.

If you have an issue with something or someone on this server, please DM **_one_** moderator (Administrator) with all relevant details. They will discuss this internally, take action and get back to you.

### Choose the right channel

When you want to post something, consider all our channels, and choose the most appropriate one _(**hint:** there are more than two)_. You are not allowed to post the same thing on multiple channels (or servers). Don't waste people's time.

## Summary

We're here to help, but we'll hold you to a standard.

Help us help you. And do it all with respect for the members here volunteering to help.
